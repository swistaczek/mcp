# Setting Up Meta Pixel (Facebook Pixel) on Fourthwall

The [Meta Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel) is ideal for tracking visitors to your site and showing them retargeting ads across Facebook and Instagram. It is a piece of code on your website that can help you better understand the effectiveness of your Facebook advertisements and the actions people take on your site, like visiting a page or adding an item to their cart.

## When should you use the Meta Pixel?

Fourthwall automatically supports the [standard Pixel Events](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/402791146561655?id=1205376682832142) (with all relevant metadata) so you can use the Meta Pixel if you want to show retargeting ads or track user behavior like:

- Page views
- View content (Product views)

If you wish, Fourthwall also supports Facebook Conversions API, which provides more accurate tracking even when ad blockers are used. For the most complete data, we recommend using both. You can read more on how to set up Facebook Conversions API here: [Connecting Facebook Conversions API to your Fourthwall Site.](https://help.fourthwall.com/hc/en-us/articles/37430330256539)

This article will guide you through adding a Meta Pixel (Facebook Pixel) to your Fourthwall shop for retargeting.
